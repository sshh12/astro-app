# PWA Starter

[**Straight to Full Documentation**](https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/starter/quick-start)

The PWABuilder pwa-starter is our opinionated, best practices, production tested starter that we use to build all of our PWAs, including [PWABuilder itself](https://blog.pwabuilder.com/posts/introducing-the-brand-new-pwa-builder/)! The pwa-starter is a starter codebase, just like create-react-app or the Angular CLI can generate, that uses the PWABuilder team&#39;s preferred front-end tech stack. We also have a CLI tool to allow you to create a PWA template from the command line.

## Jump Right In

Install the PWABuilder CLI:

`npm i -g @pwabuilder/cli`

And create a new app with this command:

`pwa create`

And start your app locally with:

`pwa start`

And that's it! Good luck on your Progressive Web App adventure!
